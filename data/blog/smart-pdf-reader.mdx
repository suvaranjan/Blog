**Smart Pdf Reader**, yes, I decided to give this name to my recently made project. As its name is Smart Pdf Reader, you can assume it’s going to be a any PDF reader project. But when I mention "smart", then what smart feature does this web app have?

Let's, before jumping to the details about this project, first I want to explain to you why I made this and what problem it solves.

I love reading physical paper books. But I don’t have enough money to buy every book I want to read, so that’s why sometimes I read PDF books. Reading a book in PDF format is not as good as reading a paper book. Still, I manage it. Sometimes I think, what if I could read a book PDF in multiple languages, like my native language? Or extract the book's page text to read it more clearly, so it gives a better reading experience?

Thank God, I own a computer and also know how to **code**, which helped me find a way to solve this. Something like this type of idea I had for more than a month, but I did not build a project to achieve this. Recently, a few days ago, I started reading the book called "Meditation." This book contains personal notebooks of Marcus Aurelius. After reading some pages, I found some complex English words. To solve this, I always copy the word and search it on Google for its meaning, which is frustrating.

So finally, I started this project [Smart Pdf Reader](https://smart-pdf-reader-v1.vercel.app/), where I can upload any PDF to read easily and smartly.

**The features are**

1. Once you upload a PDF, the website automatically processes it and takes you to the first page. There are two ways to read. You can read the page as it looks in the original PDF, or you can read it in a clear text format. This means the website pulls out the text from that page using smart technology (called OCR). It works even if your PDF is scanned, has images with text, or is a normal text-based PDF — it correctly extracts the words so you can read them more easily.

2. There is also a built-in **AI feature** that lets you read any page in **any language**. The AI reads the text on the page and translates it word by word, paragraph by paragraph, into the language you choose. You can jump to any page using a dropdown menu, and you also have simple PREV and NEXT buttons to move between pages.

Now I can super easily and smartly read a book PDF. No need to Google any word. I first read it in the original. If I think any paragraph or sentence I cannot understand, I simply read that page in my native language. For most people who want to read a book but the book's written language is not understandable for them, this can be super helpful as you can safely and correctly read any page in any language. It is FREE.

I am now learning more AI things for future features like **Chat With PDF**, which requires vector DB, text embedding, etc. I am constantly working on it. After this feature is implemented, you can just upload a PDF and AI will process the whole PDF pages, and you can chat with AI.

For now, that’s it. Hope it helps.
