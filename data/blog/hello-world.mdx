Artificial Intelligence (AI) has gone from science fiction to <RoughHighlight type="highlight" color="#ff2424" className="text-white">transforming every industry</RoughHighlight>.

## Early Days of AI

The earliest AI systems were <RoughHighlight type="underline" color="#0ea5e9">rule-based</RoughHighlight>, hardcoded with if-then logic.

These systems worked only in narrow, controlled environments.

By the 1980s, <RoughHighlight type="box" color="#e11d48">expert systems</RoughHighlight> were in use, but they were brittle and difficult to scale.

## Rise of Machine Learning

In the 2000s, <RoughHighlight type="strike-through" color="#f43f5e">rule-based approaches</RoughHighlight> gave way to data-driven methods. Machine learning allowed computers to learn patterns from data instead of relying on manual rules.

With more data and compute, algorithms like decision trees, SVMs, and later deep learning took over.

Neural networks, once dismissed, were back — and more <RoughHighlight type="circle" color="#facc15">powerful</RoughHighlight> than ever.

## Foundation Models and the Future

Today, we're in the era of <RoughHighlight type="highlight" color="#fff700" className="dark:text-black">foundation models</RoughHighlight> — large, general-purpose neural networks trained on internet-scale data.

They can write code, analyze documents, translate language, and simulate reasoning across contexts.

### Real-World Impact

- {<RoughHighlight type="crossed-off" color="#f97316">Manual translation jobs</RoughHighlight>} are increasingly handled by AI.

- Healthcare diagnostics are powered by AI with <RoughHighlight type="underline" color="#f472b6">greater accuracy</RoughHighlight> than traditional methods.
- Legal and financial services rely on AI for reviewing contracts and detecting fraud.

### Final Thoughts

While AI has incredible power, <RoughHighlight type="box" color="#94a3b8">we must consider its ethical use</RoughHighlight>. Bias, transparency, and misuse are real concerns.

But if guided responsibly,<RoughHighlight type="highlight" color="#9bff7d" multiline className="text-black">
AI could help humanity solve its hardest challenges from climate change to personalized education.</RoughHighlight>
